First, I'll need some key information: your restaurant's name, cuisine type, logo (if available), menu items with prices, business hours, location, contact details, and any specific design preferences or brand colors. For a restaurant website, I recommend including these essential sections: Home page with appealing food imagery and key information, About page telling your restaurant's story, Menu page with categorized food items and prices, Location/Hours page with an embedded map, Contact page with a reservation form, and possibly an Online Ordering system if needed. I can build this using a modern tech stack (React/Next.js frontend with a headless CMS for content management) that will ensure your site is fast, mobile-responsive, and SEO-friendly. The development process will include: designing wireframes for your approval, building the core structure, implementing responsive design, adding content management capabilities, testing across devices, and deploying to a reliable hosting service. Would you prefer a single-page design or a multi-page website? And do you need additional features like online reservations, gift cards, or integration with delivery services?"

First, I'll verify the API credentials by checking if the API keys in the agent's configuration are valid and properly formatted. API keys often have specific formats and may have expired or been revoked.\n\n2. I'll examine the API endpoint URLs to ensure they're correct and accessible. This includes checking for typos, protocol issues (http vs https), or if the endpoints have changed in recent API updates.\n\n3. I'll review recent request logs to identify specific error responses or patterns. Common issues include rate limiting (429 errors), authentication failures (401/403 errors), or service unavailability (500-series errors).\n\n4. I'll check network connectivity by testing if the agent can reach the API servers. This could involve DNS resolution issues, firewall restrictions, or proxy configuration problems.\n\n5. I'll verify the request format by ensuring the agent is formatting API requests correctly according to the documentation, including required headers, parameters, and body structure.\n\n6. I'll inspect any recent changes to the agent's code or configuration that might have introduced the issue, and review the API provider's status page for any reported outages or maintenance.\n\n7. If needed, I'll implement retry logic with exponential backoff to handle temporary connectivity issues, and add more detailed error logging to capture the exact failure points.\n\nOnce I've identified the root cause, I'll implement the appropriate fix, test the connection thoroughly, and document the solution for future reference. Would you like me to start with any specific aspect of this troubleshooting process?"

          "text": "I'll optimize your website for better performance. First, I'll conduct a comprehensive performance audit using tools like Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and GTmetrix to establish baseline metrics and identify specific bottlenecks. Based on my experience, here are the key optimization areas I'll address:\n\n1. Image optimization: I'll compress and properly size all images, convert them to modern formats like WebP, and implement lazy loading so images only load when scrolled into view.\n\n2. Code optimization: I'll minify and compress HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, eliminate render-blocking resources, and implement code splitting to load only what's needed for each page.\n\n3. Caching strategy: I'll set up proper browser caching with appropriate cache headers, implement a CDN for static assets, and utilize service workers for offline functionality where appropriate.\n\n4. Server performance: I'll analyze server response times, optimize database queries, implement server-side caching, and consider serverless functions for API endpoints.\n\n5. Critical rendering path: I'll optimize the critical rendering path by inlining critical CSS, deferring non-critical JavaScript, and prioritizing visible content loading.\n\n6. Third-party scripts: I'll audit third-party scripts, remove unnecessary ones, and load remaining scripts asynchronously or defer them when possible.\n\n7. Modern web technologies: I'll implement resource hints (preload, prefetch, preconnect), use HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 protocols, and consider static site generation or incremental static regeneration where applicable.\n\nAfter implementing these optimizations, I'll conduct follow-up performance testing to measure improvements and make additional adjustments as needed. Would you like me to prioritize any specific area first, or do you have particular performance metrics you're aiming to improve?"
