+The portfolio service should be running on port 8004 but I'm getting "Failed to fetch" error. Can you:
+1. Find where the portfolio service is supposed to start
+2. Check if there's a docker-compose.yml or startup script
+3. Show me how to start the portfolio service on port 8004

+There is no portfolio service in docker-compose.yml. I need to create a new service called "portfolio-manager" that runs on port 8004. It should:
+1. Use the same build context as other services
+2. Run a Python file called "portfolio_manager.py" 
+3. Expose port 8004
+4. Connect to the agent_network
+5. Depend on message-bus
+
+Show me the docker-compose.yml with the new portfolio-manager service added.

+Add a new service called "portfolio-manager" that runs on port 8004. Use the same pattern as the other services. It should run portfolio_manager.py and depend on message-bus.

+Create a new file called portfolio_manager.py that:
+1. Runs a Flask web server on port 8004
+2. Has a /health endpoint that returns {"status": "ok"}
+3. Has a /portfolio endpoint that returns some sample portfolio data
+4. Imports Flask and runs app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8004)
